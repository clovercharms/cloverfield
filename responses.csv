She is cute little hard working brat, always makes my day brighter and no matter how bad it is, I'm always smiling when i watch her, but i would never tell her that, acting all lovey dovey is not my thing, i shall just joke around and enjoy her content, and i wouldn't have it any other way",https://twitter.com/awysu_kun/status/1708384732533195065

You are the first person I can wholeheartedly say, youÂ´re my Oshi and nothing can change that. I wish you a nice Valantines day and hope you think about the lucky charms ;)",https://files.catbox.moe/gaa2s8.jpg
