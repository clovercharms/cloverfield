I wish I could find the words to fully express just how thankful I am for finding you. Because of you, I've improved my art skills tremendously, made many amazing friends, and had lots of laughs. You're the sweetest little bean I've had the pleasure of watching. We love you just as much as you love us, and on this special day, we'll show you how much love that truly is.
Happy Valentines, Mitty."

""Roses are red, Lucky Charms are blue, my stem alone is bigger than you.""

Hope you like it! And if you don't I'll just hide somewhere you can't reach me. Like the top shelf in the kitchen cabinets.

Happy Valentines Day!!!"
