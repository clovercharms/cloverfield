Just one of many, I confess,
the stars outside my window shine,
I wish on them as I rest.

Oh little stars please grant my wish,
and let it be when I wake,
A tender hope that she'll be there,
with a big smile on her face.

Laying here, this lonely night,
gazing up at stars so pretty,
The only wish I'm dreaming of,
is to spend each day with Mitty!

Mitty and the Lucky Charms,
